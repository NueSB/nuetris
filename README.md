# nuetris
JS tetris! (WASM version soon to be remade)

~~as ^ says, it's built for [WASMfiddle](https://wasdk.github.io/wasmfiddle) due to (cough) environment restrictions, but it can be built locally too.~~
it's been repurposed to fit onto a standablone page (lack of updates i know)- dev has been split into wasm and regular js versions due to, again, environment restrictions
